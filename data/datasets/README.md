# `datasets` Directory

The `datasets` directory is intended to store dataset files used by the data processing and modeling workflows in this package.  

Currently, it contains:

- **ERA5 multi-level data for a single timestamp**: This dataset provides atmospheric variables at multiple vertical levels, serving as an example or test dataset for data loading, preprocessing, and analysis routines.

**Purpose:**  
- Serve as a centralized location for dataset storage within the package.
- Facilitate reproducibility by keeping example datasets bundled with the package.
- Provide reference data for testing, debugging, or demonstrating data processing functions.

**Future Use:**  
- Additional datasets can be added here to support training, evaluation, or benchmarking of models.
